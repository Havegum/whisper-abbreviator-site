During her season, winds are known to shift unpredictably, though some currents becomes incredibly stable and reliable. These Windpaths are meticulously tracked by Orian mathematicians and windkeepers to determine where one might open, and where one leads. Allows for fast, safe, and long-range travel of large windkites.Akari: The Nerai (Nomads dwelling in the Vestari Valleys) follow the stars representing Arkai across Vestari lands each cycle - they move with Arkai's passing.

This wind marks a heightened period of sorcery, and the most important hunts of the Orian cycle which sustains the precious supplies needed to maintain wards and most forms of sorcery. In modern times many supplies are traded and stockpiled from other cultures, but some Orians still partake in hunts by way of tradition or seeking personal glory and wealth.Nearly all Orian practicioners of Warding start their practial training during Ys-Kora to better understand the Flame before mastering it many Cycles later.Adiyah: Now, the Arts are three: Flame, Spirit, and Creation. Flame can change one thing into another - usually power, such as abyssal ink into a gust of wind. The same Flame can be bound with words or writing. This is the basis of how we create wards.Ys-Kora's Flame is described by many practicioners as making their own small alterations to a story as it's being told. Wards are a \"stable\" version of this art - where these stories has already been bound to an object, such as paper, waiting to be told.Murus: Some of the northern Tribes sustain themselves entierly by a successful hunt during this current. Creatures of the deep are known to surface more frequently, and amongst these are the greatest leviathans of the deep. Aside from the meat and blubber used to sustain a Tribe the Oil is highly coveted by Orian traders which fuels our economy. Hinekoran hunts are allowed for proven warbands, and only fools would attempt one without cycles-long training. To hunt a leviathan without proper tradition and respect is to invite doom upon all Tribes.Akari: Tal-Kovai is a dangerous time in the Sea of Clouds. After a full Wind of spirts gathering, many large beasts wake from their cycle-long slumber to feast.

It is a very rare, powerful, and coveted art. Common uses include warping the wind to move across immense distances, divining what is hidden, or casting ones perception across vast gulfs of time and space. This art is extremely hard to master and rarely sees use except for ancient masters of very powerful sorcerers.I know a fragment of this art, and that is to let Wind shape me to move quickly.Akari: Adiyah makes is sound way too complicated.

They are the Creator of all Spirits, and the source of all primal sorcery.Adiyah: Listen well, for Akarot holds the most powerful and dangerous Art to master, the rarest of all three. Theirs is a dark Flame of starlight and nightsky. The Black Flame has one fundemental use, and that is to create something from nothing, allowing direct creation of matter, energy, and life.

It is believed that the wind formed the northern land called Niros long before the arrival of mortal races.

Whatever happened this Yre was not normal.The party has fought multiple creatures forged or warped by the storm itself. This includes beasts, elemental-like creatures, and a humanoid bear speaking in the same manner as some spiritborne and eidolons where the meaning of their words transcends language (the party could understand it despite not sharing any languages).The camp was attacked by hundreds of creatures during a massive storm.

For others, death changes them significantly, and they adopt a new worldview in light ofwhat their death has taught them.Dead Immortality.You do not age. Given time, the necromantic energies that sustain you will heal most wounds you take at approximately the same rate as a mortal, and your hit dice function as normal.Past Life.Choose another race besides this one, which must be humanoid and lack the Living Construct trait (or similar). Before your death, you were a member of this race and appear as an undead version of it.Your size, height, and movement speed are the same as a typical member of that race. You do not retain special movement speeds from this race (such as swimming or flying) or any of the race's other racial traits. If your Past Life race has subraces, you can select one, but it confers no benefits.Living Dead.You have been raised from death, but regaining your autonomy has returned to you some of the spark of life. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish.Additionally, you have two creature types: humanoid and undead. You can be affected by a spell or ability if it works on either of your creature types.Restless.As an undead, you very rarely tire. You treat exhaustion as if it was one level less. In addition, instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.Unholy.Unlike other undead, you can be restored through healing magic, but it has a significantly dampened effect on you. When you regain hit points from a source that specifies it does not function on undead, you only receive half as many hit points as the source would normally provide, rounded down.Darkvision.Through the necromantic energy animating you, you are able to perceive with greater clarity that which lurks in the darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.Bloodless.You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.Languages.You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language, typically one available to the race you chose for your Past Life. If your Past Life race has a trait that precludes speech (such as a kenku's Mimicry), you are still not able to speak and instead gain access to the relevant trait of your Past Life race that substitutes speech.Optional Rule: Truly Dead[\u2013]The undead presented in this option are intended to be easily accessible to players, and thus have features players would expect from other races. They can be magically healed (albeit at a reduced rate), and affected by spells such as charm person or hold person.However, you or your DM can choose to make awakened undead into fully undead characters. If this is the case, your Living Dead trait does not grant the humanoid type, and you do not have the Unholy trait.This option increases the difficulty for an undead character, as well as that character's reliance on hit dice and spells such as goodberry or regenerate that do not exclude undead. Playing a fully undead character may be too much for novice players, but a veteran player could enjoy the challenge.Death comes for all things in a near-infinite variety of ways. So, too, are there many reasons that the dead might return from the grave. Directly-applied necromancy, cursed lands, and unfinished business are but a few, and all leave the newly-undead soul with a mere semblance of the life it had before. All undead carry the physical or emotional scars of what ended their mortal lives, though some may be far more subtle than others.Dead and Reborn[\u2013]Typically having no lands to call their own, undead with an awakened sense of self are usually perpetual foreigners, wanders in a land and often a time they do not belong to. Compounding matters, most mortal cultures carry with them an instinctual fear of death and the dead, and many associate necromancy specifically with dark tidings. This forms a wall of (often well-earned) prejudice and hatred that sentient undead find themselves up against, and many undead choose to hide their necrotic natures behind clothes, masks, and pungent perfumes when journeying into civilization.Depending on composition, humanoid undead typically range a wide gamut from 20 to 300 pounds, and may possess empty eyes, a colored flame-like magical animus in their sockets, or harrowed, surprisingly mortal eyes burning with an inner fire. Hair (if they have it at all) is usually lank, dark, and wrought with grime and gravedirt that no amount of cleaning will fully remove.Service and Freedom[\u2013]Undeath is effectively immortality, a strong reason why many mortal spellcasters of a certain moral bent consider it a viable alternative to actually dying. Still, it is not immortality without a price; senses and emotions dull, food and drink no longer have taste, and often an undead state comes alongside a subservience of will and unthinking toil beneath a merciless and malevolent master.Some undead are born into freedom, while others earn it or have it thrust upon them. Regardless, all undead that are not bound greatly cherish their liberday, as the reminders of what could easily happen were they not fortunate enough to possess free will abound throughout history. Many awakened undead consider it their sacred duty to free other mindless undead, or simply to dispatch them wherever they may be found. The reasoning is straightforward enough: a final rest awarded to all mortals is greatly preferential to eternal slavery to the likes of a short-sighted, megalomaniacal spellcaster.Fallen Home, Forgotten Past[\u2013]For many awakened undead, the past is a distant homeland to which they may never return, holding names and faces now partially-forgotten, and loves and lives as dead as they are. The anguish of this loss is enough to drive many mad, but others use this rage and pain as a source of power and drive, carrying them further on the road to whatever dark destiny awaits.Frequently, entire countries, customs, and cultures an undead may be familiar with no longer exist, and the sentient dead behaves or speaks in an antiquated fashion because of this. These undead may find it more difficult than usual to relate to modern mortals, usually leveraging what companions they find to bridge this epoch-long communication gap.Undead Names[\u2013]Many undead that awaken into sentience prefer to keep the names they held in their mortal lives. For others, however, their mortal names are forgotten or have lost meaning. These undead often adopt nicknames given to them by their former masters or present companions, and hold them to be as true as any other creature's birth name.Examples of names given in this fashion can be seen, below:Names: Bane, Carver, Clatter, Crumble, Drudge, Minion, Mort, Pale, Rattlebones, Raven, Rook, Rotface, Shade, Shiver, Spore, Wisp"]}, {"name": "Scroll", "pages": [""]}, {"name": "Tidestone Coast", "pages": ["", "", "", "", "Ability ScoresSizeSpeedCon +2; Wis +1Medium25 ft., swim 30 ft.Age.Karkinos are unique in that they are effectively immortal.

They are like the shepherds of the entire ocean, gently guiding us toward a better future. I wonder what tragedy befell their kind to bestow them with such cautious wisdom?\u201d\u2014 Wolyn Ahlorsath, triton explorerThe karkinos are a race of powerful but furtive crustacean humanoids. A race without a home, they are peaceful pastoralists, who drift between underwater realms, aiding those who seek it and staying out of the paths of those who would seek to harm them. Normally gentle giants, in times of trouble karkinos can become valiant heroes who rise up to protect their ocean home.Obscure Hermits[\u2013]The karkinos have a muddied origin; some say that they were once a race of surface folk who were cursed into their current forms, while others claim they migrated from the Elemental Plane of water alongside the tritons. The karkinos themselves have conflicting legends, owing to their nomadic lifestyle resulting in many cultural groups emerging, each attesting to their own lore.Regardless of their origins, most karkinos, especially those who hold to traditional beliefs, live a life of idyllic pastoralism. Herding flocks of giant crustaceans, schools of fish, and other placid oceanic life, karkinos families spend their days gazing into the endless depths and ruminating on the nature of the sea. Some karkinos are poets, whose musings are spread far and wide through underwater society, sung and rewritten as ballads and plays. Others isolate themselves far away from civilization with nothing more than their family or flocks for company. Living lives of quiet contemplation, they meditate on ancient truths only known to the long-lived and mysterious karkinos.Typically dwelling at the seafloor, the existence of the karkinos is something known only to daring ocean adventurers, though legends about these mysterious crustacean people do spring up from time to time amid sailors and fishermen. Tritons, merfolk, and other intelligent civilizations of the sea may interact with the karkinos more frequently, though even then the karkinos' nomadic and secluded lifestyle makes these interactions relatively rare and spontaneous.Ocean Guardians[\u2013]Despite their peaceful and quiet ways, the karkinos are known too for great heroism in times of need. With a creed to suffer no injustice and to extend aid where possible, most karkinos are happy to lend a claw to passing merfolk, triton, or even surface races where possible, though these encounters may be rare. Some karkinos go above and beyond, and utilize their prodigious natural strength and defenses to protect those who have need of it. These karkinos are often those who depart from their families to seek adventure, striking an impressive silhouette among groups of aquatic adventurers.Even besides these heroic individuals, the karkinos have a long rivalry with malicious creatures of the deep. Sahuagin who terrorize other races, krakens fouling the waters, and other beasts of the deep are all ancestral enemies of the karkinos, and they require little persuasion to mobilize against such threats. In times of turmoil, the karkinos usually prove to be vigilant guardians who rise up above the chaos to protect the safety of the oceans. For that reason, tritons and karkinos have traditionally had a good relationship, both being defenders of the ocean.Ancient Karkos[\u2013]In ancient times, it is said that the crab-folk once had a homeland known as Karkos. A legendary city of resplendent gold and coral, it was a mythic land of plenty and wonder, considered the jewel of the sea. Many karkinos families still claim to possess relics from this wondrous age, although few truly believe they have a treasure from the fabled city itself, only an old heirloom from a bygone era.The tale, as it goes, describes Karkos falling into a state of hubris and debauchery. The most powerful of Karkos were swayed into evil by a malicious kraken, and attempted to harness and control the very currents of the ocean, to bend the sea to their will. In retribution, the spirits of the sea sent a mighty sea titan to swallow up the entirety of Karkos, sweeping the city into the eternal depths, never to be seen again. While most karkinos believe this to be nothing more than a moral fable, they still point to it as reason for their humble life and staunch opposition to the darker denizens of the sea.The Truth Behind the Myths[\u2013]The city of Karkos, the protector of the karkinos, is regarded as fable by many. However, ancient Karkos slumbers beneath the waves.Karkinos Names[\u2013]Karkinos names are often difficult to pronounce by most tongues, due to their crustacean nature, with many hard clicks and other harsh sounds. Karkinos who decide to befriend non-karkinos individuals typically have a nickname derived from a simplified form of their true name. Karkinos, being natural hermaphrodites, have little use for gender dimorphism and their names follow a similar thread, though some karkinos do choose to adopt a pronoun for ease of communication.Karkinos Names (Nicknames). Klimkaklaeia (Limalaeia), Kaklitakades (Atakades), Kokakinikea (Konikea), Kakageakina (Aegeana), Kekantakita (Ketanita), Pakiketakea (Pakatea), Petakikekatis (Petakis), Thekakameika (Themaika), Tehikagankis (Teaganis),Takitamekika (Takameia)Karkinos In Other Realms[\u2013]There are other races throughout the multiverse that bear a striking resemblance to the karkinos\u2014for example, the aldani of the Forgotten Realms, the sartani, and the crab men that are scattered throughout the annals of history.

They can be heard miles from shore, joining with the din of the ocean waves to create haunting melodies. Sailors are always blaming them for shipwrecks, of course, but I imagine that's a convenient excuse when you crash your own ship on the shoals.\u201d\u2014 Chalcodon, philosopher of MytrosArkadians[\u2013]Sirens are a race of winged, aquatic humanoids that typically dwell near rocky sea cliffs. They are famed for their beautiful voices, which they use to sing haunting lamentations, captivating listeners and transporting them to a bygone age. Sirens are rarely found very far inland. They prefer to remain near the coasts, as the gentle roar of the ocean waves calms their roiling emotions.Sirens typically experience fluctuating moods from one day to the next, ranging from extreme joy and hope for the future, to extreme sorrow and pessimism. No matter how a siren feels, she expresses her emotion through song. On good days, she may annoy her companions with chirpy melodies and vocal warm-ups as she glides around on outstretched wings. Bad days, on the other hand, may see her moaning and wailing and dragging her feet.Legend of the Sirens[\u2013]The sirens once lived on a great expanse of shoals in the Cerulean Gulf, where they built a city of brilliant white limestone. Its towering spires and pillars thrust out from the rocky waters, allowing the sirens to fly or swim as they pleased. They lived here in joy, singing praises to Sydon, who governed the oceans. Sydon heard this from his throne in Praxys and scowled. \"Were they truly grateful, they would not build their towers to rival mine.\"When the sirens learned that Sydon was displeased, they were heartbroken. They dismantled their towers and composed new melodies\u2014songs of repentance\u2014which once more carried on the winds to the ears of the Titan. He was unmoved. \"Were they truly repentant, they would not sing so brazenly, but they would go meekly and offer the proper sacrifices in place of songs.\"This time, the sirens were utterly stricken. They had believed that their songs were cherished by the gods. Their voices were stilled, and in the ensuing silence, the brilliance of the city faded into shadow. Stone foundations cracked, and pediments grew heavy. The pillars collapsed, and the city of the sirens sank deep into the ocean, swallowed by churning waters. Even its name was forgotten.Centuries passed in silence. Eventually, a new song began\u2014an endless lamentation for the city that now sleeps on the ocean floor. When Lutheria learned that the city of the sirens had been destroyed, she laughed. She captured an entire flock of the pitiful creatures and gleefully cursed them, twisting them into something monstrous. These were the first harpies.Ocean Lovers[\u2013]Sirens are not amphibious, but they are well-adapted for living in and around water. They are thought to descend from an ancient Nereid who fell in love with an avian celestial. Iridescent scales cover many parts of their body, and their taloned hands and feet are excellent for fishing. They live in small flocks along the shores of the ocean. Siren artwork, poetry, and architecture emphasize their special relationship with both the clouds above and the sea below.Mournful Singers[\u2013]Every siren is born with an abiding sense of sorrow that never fades\u2014a soul-crushing grief caused by the loss of her ancestral home. From an early age, sirens learn to sing the ancient songs of their lost city, which evoke heart-wrenching memories of a time that will never come again. Anyone who hears a siren's song is immediately mesmerized by the overwhelming emotion conveyed by her beautiful voice. Some are moved to tears\u2014others collapse into catatonia. The siren herself is not exempt from this\u2014the moment she hears her own lamentations, she experiences an intense pang of loss.Winged Messengers[\u2013]Sirens have broad, feathered wings growing out of their backs, which allow them to fly like birds. For this reason, sirens are often employed as messengers, tasked with conveying satchels of written letters from one city to another. However, a siren can only fly when her heart is filled with light. On such days, her songs are bright and joyful, no matter what manner of message she carries. Thus the saying, \"A siren in good spirits may yet carry ill news.\"Siren Names[\u2013]Sirens have names that sound lyrical and sad. They are ancient names, carried down from generation to generation, and each is associated with an ancestral song. Sirens choose their own names when they come of age, selecting one from the song that moves them most deeply.Male Names: Alovar, Celeus, Everean, Gaiar, Helean, Inareus, Leiro, Meiar, Nerean, Oren, Reilan, TaerenFemale Names: Alovarea, Celea, Everea, Gaia, Helena, Inarea, Leira, Meia, Nerea, Orena, Reilana, Taerena", "Ability ScoresSizeSpeedDex +2; Cha +1Medium30 ft.Age.Satyrs mature quickly, reaching adulthood by their early teens.

And I prefer the company of my snakes to that of lesser mortals.\"\u201d\u2014 Moxena, the Lady of CoinsLegend of the Medusa[\u2013]Thousands of years ago, a woman came to Thylea seeking her fortune. When the creatures of that land asked her from whence she came, she would only say, \"I am from the land of the Gorgons.\" In those days, Thylea was rich in natural beauty but poor in wealth. But the woman would not be deterred.Gold and Bronze[\u2013]Dwarves have strong, prominent features. Field dwarves have skin tanned and weathered by many years of sun and soil in the fields. Volcano dwarves have a slightly lighter complexion due to their lives spend toiling under the mountains. While field dwarves tend to dress simply, volcano dwarves take deep pride in their appearance. Their hair and beards, black or reddish brown, is worn in matted locks. They cap these coils in heavy beads of gold, bronze, or mountain glass. They trade with humans for royal colors of cloth and adorn themselves with thick rings and armbands, set with wide stones.First, the woman searched the steppes and mountains, and she came to the centaurs, asking, \"Where may I find gems and jewels to rival the stars?\" The centaurs offered her a shank of lamb and said, \"Why seek gems and jewels when the stars are free to everyone?\" Disappointed, she cast away the food and left the centaurs to their star-gazing.Then the woman searched the forests, and she came to the satyrs, asking, \"Where may I find rivers of gold and silver that flow like fountains?\" The satyrs offered her a goblet of wine and said, \"Gold and silver make a very poor feast. Wouldn't you rather join us for a song and a drink?\" Disappointed again, the woman cast away the goblet and left the satyrs to their revelry.Now, the woman wandered high and low, seeking her fortune to no avail, and finally she came upon three women weaving at a loom. She said, \"I wish for riches beyond the imagination of all the creatures that haunt this accursed land.\" The three women, who were the Fates, warned her. \"Is this truly what you desire? You may have it, but the price will be high.\" And the woman answered, \"When I am rich, I shall have no trouble paying any price.\" And the Fates said, \"So be it.\"The woman's eyes suddenly gleamed like golden coins, and wherever she turned her gaze, creatures were turned to stone. \"So that none may rob you of your treasure,\" said the Fates. The woman's hair grew long and sinuous, slithering and scaled like snakes. \"So that always you will have the company of hearts as cold as your own.\" And finally, the woman's hands were filled with gems and coins that were beautiful beyond the reckoning of stars or songs. Her name was Medusa, and she was the namesake of her curse, which afflicts many such mortals with more ambition than sense.Cursed by Dark Powers[\u2013]Medusae have typically made bargains with some sort of fiend or fiendish power, but in some cases, they are oathbreakers who have displeased the gods or the Fates. Either way, they have been afflicted with the curse of the medusa as punishment, and recovery from the curse is not possible without the use of powerful magic. In some cases, even the greater restoration spell may not be enough to break the curse. But in many other cases, the medusa simply embraces the curse as part of her identity. Children born to medusae are also affected by the curse.Ophidian Schemers[\u2013]Medusae are known to spend much of their time plotting against those who rival them in wealth, power, or beauty. Some medusae name their snakes and speak to them as if they were speaking to cherished pets or loved ones. Others are ashamed of their curse and seek to break it.

Travel widely enough and you will come to know shopkeepers, poets, and philosophers with the faces of bulls. True, there are some who are monsters. But is that not also true of men?\"\u201d\u2014 Aesop, Keeper of the Dragon ShrineLegend of the Minotaurs[\u2013]Over a thousand years ago, a tribe of humans washed ashore in Thylea and came to live in the southern hills of the Aresian peninsula. Here, they laid foundations for a city and called it Minos. But not one man or woman among them had the strength to till the hard, rocky soil. As fate would have it, they discovered a magnificent bull that could pull a plow through any terrain for days without resting. Using the bull's great strength, they were able to produce bountiful crops with which to survive the first winter.Over time, the people of the tribe began to venerate the bull, crowning him as the god of the harvest. When Sydon learned of this, he was furious. He threw curses down upon the settlers and transformed them into bulls, in mockery of their insolence. Each of them was harnessed to a plow and forced to tread the same winding, geometric path, until that path became a deep, labyrinthian gorge. Eventually, the plows broke, and the people of Minos slowly began to stand upright again\u2014but their faces had been forever changed by the curse.The people of the tribe came to be called minotaurs\u2014the bulls of Minos\u2014and they have never fully shed their bull-like demeanors. Some of them merely have horns and a snout-like nose, while others have the entire upper torso of a bull. Some continued to dwell in the labyrinth, while others left to explore the far reaches of Thylea. Over the centuries, they have come to view their own cursed existence as the will of the Fates.Warrior Bulls[\u2013]Minotaurs possess uncommon strength, making them excellent warriors. The curse infuses their bodies with the power of a bull at all times, and their muscles seldom relax, even when they are drunk or asleep. In battle, minotaurs sometimes lose control of their emotions and fly into a rage. When this happens, the curse takes over, transforming them back into a full-fledged bull for a short period of time.Oathbound Slaves[\u2013]Minotaurs are widely shunned, because they are believed to be unthinking brutes who have been cursed by the gods. Most minotaurs gather together to form small farming or fishing communities, far from civilization. The only way that most minotaurs can find work in cities and villages is to swear oaths of service that effectively reduce them to the status of slaves. Many bear this humiliation with stoic grit, but others resort to banditry rather than submit to the unreasonable demands of cowardly superstition.Minotaur Names[\u2013]Minotaurs generally prefer names that are short and simple. They typically punctuate their names with a snort or a sharp exhalation of air through their nostrils. When someone omits this part of their name, they become annoyed.Names: Arxan, Braz, Dregxa, Elagore, Garnox, Horus, Kath, Luth, Manx, Parth, Raxus, Steth, Torag, Zark", "Ability ScoresSizeSpeedCon +2; Wis +1Medium25 ft.Age.Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50.

Your size is Medium.Languages.You can speak, read, and write Common, Thelyan, and Dwarvish. When carved or written, Dwarvish appears as rows of horizontal and vertical fletched lines. Dwarves often use clay tablets to tally payments, account for shipments of ore, or send messages. It can be etched on leaves of copper and gold as a prayer to the gods.These metal scrolls are then melted into the bronze of swords or armor, believed to imbue them with the words of the smith.Darkvision.Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

A creature can use its action to eat one or more of these grapes. Eating a grape restores 1 hit point, and the grape provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. You must finish a long rest before using this ability again.The grapes lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the use of this ability. The number of grapes created increases to 8d4 at 11th level and 16d4 at 17th level.Theylan dwarves are simple folk. They have a love of wine, and growing things, and rich, dark earth. They take great pleasure in the deliberate perfection of stacked stone shepherds' walls and village wells, fitting each stone to the next.In the countryside they tend the soil, planting vineyards and olive trees. From the clay of the earth, they fire pots and vases of orange and black to bear the fruits of their labor. Their wines and oils are as renowned as the clay pottery that holds them.Some thelyan dwarves are drawn to the promise of the cities. Their proud stonework is far advanced from that of their country kin. They turn their hammers and chisels to the columns, statues, and fountains that adorn the great cities of men. Their kilns fire clay figures, vases, and the terracotta tiles found on many a roof throughout Eora.It is said thelyan dwarves built the walls of Thell, when the land was young, of huge stacked stones from the bosom of Eora. When asked why they did not mortar the stones together, the dwarves replied that mortar may crack and chip, but stone upon stone, perfectly laid, will last as long as the hills.\u201cThe stone pillars of the great hall stared down at Bakis with the carved faces of the dwarven kings of Erebos, illuminated by the steady orange glow of the volcano's blood. It flowed in stone channels, carried from deep within the living heart of the mountain. In spite of its warmth, wide bronze braziers blazed between the columns, yet even their heat was swallowed by the great forge.With slow deliberation, Bakis lowered the crucible, cracked and glowing as the lava itself, and poured the molten bronze. It spilled in a white-hot fall, flowing into the lines of the mold chiseled into the plinth before him. It was one of the oldest, carved from the very stone of the chamber. Slowly, the metal took its shape, the blazing, broad-leafed silhouette of a sword.\u201d\u2014 AnonKin of Erebos[\u2013]The dwarves say Erebos made them in his image. From carved stone and molten bronze he gave them life and into them poured the best of him, his enduring strength and skill. They say Kor Erebos was the forge where they were born, the fist forge. And since Erebos gave them that flame, the fire of the gods, never has it gone cold.It was there in that first fire that he forged the weapons of the gods for their great battle with the Titans for the heart of Eora. Beneath the sacred mountain, in shadow and the glow of bronze he toiled and made for the gods many wondrous things. For Krytos he made a spear that could never fail to strike and a shield to make him unbeatable in combat. For Thessa he made a trident, to hold within it all the secrets of the roiling sea. And to Hyperius he gave a chain of Orchalcum, unbreakable, and his greatest gift\u2014a javelin of pure lightning that held within its crackling form all the power of the heavens' wrath.Gold and Bronze[\u2013]Dwarves have strong, prominent features. Field dwarves have skin tanned and weathered by many years of sun and soil in the fields. Volcano dwarves have a slightly lighter complexion due to their lives spend toiling under the mountains. While field dwarves tend to dress simply, volcano dwarves take deep pride in their appearance. Their hair and beards, black or reddish brown, is worn in matted locks. They cap these coils in heavy beads of gold, bronze, or mountain glass. They trade with humans for royal colors of cloth and adorn themselves with thick rings and armbands, set with wide stones.Forge and Field[\u2013]The dwarves of Erebos say that in the beginning, all the dwarves called the mountains home. As some toiled at the mountains base, Phaedrus lured them away from their work with wine, and a bountiful feast. It is said those dwarves never returned to their mountain home, but followed Phaedrus into the hills and fields, and thus as the field dwarves they became known.Volcano dwarves do not think much of their cousins in the fields. They believe that Erebos created dwarves to be workers, viewing the field dwarves as lazy and unskilled. The field dwarves, in turn, think their kin in the volcanoes are too secretive and serious.Volcano dwarves tend to like field dwarves best when they are producing good work. Field dwarves, on the other hand, like volcano dwarves best once they've tried a bit of field dwarven wine.Keepers of the Flame[\u2013]Mount Erebos, or Kor Erebos in the dwarven tongue, is the most sacred site of their people. The fires of its great forge are fed from the blood of the mountain and its flames have never died. The elders, smith-priests of Erebos, tend the fire and forge the weapons of kings and heroes. Ancient channels are carved in the stones of the floor for molten bronze to flow. Some of these molds are said to have been used to forge the legendary weapons of the gods. It is one of the few places where orichalcum can be worked. This rare golden-bronze metal, sacred to Eberos, is found only in Gargaros, drawn from the fiery peaks of that broken land. Many horrible monstrosities bound to the Titans are seared by its golden touch, making its weapons prized by the bravest of Arkadia's heroes. Weapons and armor that are wrought from it are more precious than gold, though they can never be sold, only given.Though the dwarves call the volcanic mountains of Kor Erebos and its foothills their home, they can be found throughout Arkadia, lighting forges in each of the great cities. They consider themselves Arkadians, in their blood, as much as the race of men and share with them a deep hatred of the orcs of Gargaros. Their masterful crafts are highly valued and sought after. They make crystal glass and beaten lead funeral masks in Crixos; jewelry in Corinth; and rams, nails, and all the tools needed to furnish Ithean ships. Their most common work, however, is found in Kryta and Hyperium, where the bronze of their swords and spears and armor is prized above all others.Dwarf Names[\u2013]Dwarves have only a single name, given at birth by the elders of their forge. Many dwarves write their names as a unique maker's mark to distinguish their work and identify where it was made, whether scratched into the clay underside of a pot, chiseled into the base of a statue, or stamped on the back of a golden pendant.Male Names: Agamemnon, Bakis, Bokolus, Bienor, Bortes, Branchus, Bormus, Cordus, Clytus, Demophon, Elpenor, Glaucus, Hebros, Haemus, Imbrius, Lampus, Leodokus,Magnes, Nestor, Oxylus, Phlegyas, Pittheus, Rhadamanthys, Telemon, Thaddaeus, PrometheusFemale Names: Agatha, Batea, Bianna, Bolina, Briseis, Cydona, Deianeira, Demetra, Diomede, Gerana, Hecamede, Hilaera, Halimede, Ino, Laodamia,Medea, Myrina,Myrrha, Perimede, Phoebe, Ptolema, Rhadine, Thisbe, TimandraMaker's Name: Volcano dwarves identify with the city or place where they work, as it implies their craft.

It marks the passage of time and allows us to progress time without playing through every day of our adventurer\u2019s lives. Between missions, and during respite, the party spends time at their liberty, attending to personal needs and projects. During a downtime phase the players are either given Downtime Days, or Respite. During Extended Downtime each player character has two Extended Downtime Actions. One or multiple of these can be swapped for Respite Actions if requested. Downtime Days marks time where the character has many days, or weeks, at their disposal. During this time the characters can focus on a multitude of actions. Including, but not limited to:Crafting requires readily available resources. Trying to craft items of significant value while the crafter and their supplies are low tier simply won't work. Many Crafting-related actions require generic or specific resources. Some of these are generated through missions, adventuring, narrative advancement, or scavenging. A player may for example start a long-term project to generate more Building Stocks to help expedite a later building project.Crafting - Mundane - Masterwork - Project - Magic - Upgrade - SpecialWhenever you take the Crafting action you spend your time working on a project ranging from personal equipment, buildings, structures, building upgrades, magic item crafting, potion making, or a multitude of related fields.Some projects in the Camp may have a Crafting tag - indicating that it can be worked towards by anyone.

Said to bedescended from Erebos himself, they are great metalworkers, jewelers, and glass-cutters. They are a mysterious and reclusive folk, withdrawn from the world and protective of the secrets of their crafts.They carve their homes deep in the rock of Arkadia's oldest mountains, so deep that they tap into the very blood of the earth. Lava heats their everlit forges, shedding warmth and light; as it is the heart of the mountain, so too is it the heart of their people.In the orange glow of their forges they pour molten bronze into the molds of swords and armor. Their work is prized and highly sought after by Hyperium, Ithea, and Kryta alike. They trade freely, for they boast deep love of gold and take great pride in its accolades.They do not produce only instruments of war, but are also the finest jewelers and glaziers in all Arkadia. Both their jewelry and their glass is thick and heavy as its craftsmen. They mine gold from deep in the earth and with it strike coins and craft things of wonder fit for kings. The excess sand from their tunnels is not wasted, but spun into molten strands in the magma of their forges, for they know the secrets of glass and how to make stone flow.\u201cThe stone pillars of the great hall stared down at Bakis with the carved faces of the dwarven kings of Erebos, illuminated by the steady orange glow of the volcano's blood. It flowed in stone channels, carried from deep within the living heart of the mountain. In spite of its warmth, wide bronze braziers blazed between the columns, yet even their heat was swallowed by the great forge.With slow deliberation, Bakis lowered the crucible, cracked and glowing as the lava itself, and poured the molten bronze. It spilled in a white-hot fall, flowing into the lines of the mold chiseled into the plinth before him. It was one of the oldest, carved from the very stone of the chamber. Slowly, the metal took its shape, the blazing, broad-leafed silhouette of a sword.\u201d\u2014 AnonKin of Erebos[\u2013]The dwarves say Erebos made them in his image. From carved stone and molten bronze he gave them life and into them poured the best of him, his enduring strength and skill. They say Kor Erebos was the forge where they were born, the fist forge. And since Erebos gave them that flame, the fire of the gods, never has it gone cold.It was there in that first fire that he forged the weapons of the gods for their great battle with the Titans for the heart of Arkadia. Beneath the sacred mountain, in shadow and the glow of bronze he toiled and made for the gods many wondrous things. For Krytos he made a spear that could never fail to strike and a shield to make him unbeatable in combat. For Thessa he made a trident, to hold within it all the secrets of the roiling sea. And to Hyperius he gave a chain of Orchalcum, unbreakable, and his greatest gift\u2014a javelin of pure lightning that held within its crackling form all the power of the heavens' wrath.Gold and Bronze[\u2013]Dwarves have strong, prominent features. Field dwarves have skin tanned and weathered by many years of sun and soil in the fields. Volcano dwarves have a slightly lighter complexion due to their lives spend toiling under the mountains. While field dwarves tend to dress simply, volcano dwarves take deep pride in their appearance. Their hair and beards, black or reddish brown, is worn in matted locks. They cap these coils in heavy beads of gold, bronze, or mountain glass. They trade with humans for royal colors of cloth and adorn themselves with thick rings and armbands, set with wide stones.Forge and Field[\u2013]The dwarves of Erebos say that in the beginning, all the dwarves called the mountains home. As some toiled at the mountains base, Phaedrus lured them away from their work with wine, and a bountiful feast. It is said those dwarves never returned to their mountain home, but followed Phaedrus into the hills and fields, and thus as the field dwarves they became known.Volcano dwarves do not think much of their cousins in the fields. They believe that Erebos created dwarves to be workers, viewing the field dwarves as lazy and unskilled. The field dwarves, in turn, think their kin in the volcanoes are too secretive and serious.Volcano dwarves tend to like field dwarves best when they are producing good work. Field dwarves, on the other hand, like volcano dwarves best once they've tried a bit of field dwarven wine.Keepers of the Flame[\u2013]Mount Erebos, or Kor Erebos in the dwarven tongue, is the most sacred site of their people. The fires of its great forge are fed from the blood of the mountain and its flames have never died. The elders, smith-priests of Erebos, tend the fire and forge the weapons of kings and heroes. Ancient channels are carved in the stones of the floor for molten bronze to flow. Some of these molds are said to have been used to forge the legendary weapons of the gods. It is one of the few places where orichalcum can be worked. This rare golden-bronze metal, sacred to Eberos, is found only in Gargaros, drawn from the fiery peaks of that broken land. Many horrible monstrosities bound to the Titans are seared by its golden touch, making its weapons prized by the bravest of Arkadia's heroes. Weapons and armor that are wrought from it are more precious than gold, though they can never be sold, only given.Though the dwarves call the volcanic mountains of Kor Erebos and its foothills their home, they can be found throughout Arkadia, lighting forges in each of the great cities. They consider themselves Arkadians, in their blood, as much as the race of men and share with them a deep hatred of the orcs of Gargaros. Their masterful crafts are highly valued and sought after. They make crystal glass and beaten lead funeral masks in Crixos; jewelry in Corinth; and rams, nails, and all the tools needed to furnish Ithean ships. Their most common work, however, is found in Kryta and Hyperium, where the bronze of their swords and spears and armor is prized above all others.Dwarf Names[\u2013]Dwarves have only a single name, given at birth by the elders of their forge. Many dwarves write their names as a unique maker's mark to distinguish their work and identify where it was made, whether scratched into the clay underside of a pot, chiseled into the base of a statue, or stamped on the back of a golden pendant.Male Names: Agamemnon, Bakis, Bokolus, Bienor, Bortes, Branchus, Bormus, Cordus, Clytus, Demophon, Elpenor, Glaucus, Hebros, Haemus, Imbrius, Lampus, Leodokus,Magnes, Nestor, Oxylus, Phlegyas, Pittheus, Rhadamanthys, Telemon, Thaddaeus, PrometheusFemale Names: Agatha, Batea, Bianna, Bolina, Briseis, Cydona, Deianeira, Demetra, Diomede, Gerana, Hecamede, Hilaera, Halimede, Ino, Laodamia,Medea, Myrina,Myrrha, Perimede, Phoebe, Ptolema, Rhadine, Thisbe, TimandraMaker's Name: Volcano dwarves identify with the city or place where they work, as it implies their craft. For example, a dwarf might introduce himself as Bakis of Kryta, implying that he works with bronze and is possibly a smith or armorer."]}, {"name": "Hastily gathered information - North Western Ruins", "pages": ["Letter 1\nMAKER - erratically scribbled above the note\n(Note attached to letter)\nRemember, Sunder, If the bonesmith fails, the binding fails.

If intensified: Non-magical attacks have a permanent -5 penalty to rolls while within the storm.\nSmother the flame: All sources of open flame not under overhead cover or enclosed with some kind of protection is exstinguished. If intensified: Removes all sources of flame, reduces all fire damage taken by 50%.\nPrimeval Power: Powerful storms randomly appears within the battlefield, unpredictably changing any power and magic-like effects within them. Each time a spellcaster tries to cast a spell while within the storm's area, their spells level either increases by 1d4 points or decreases by 1d4 points (minimum of 1) (50% chance for each). This alteration applies only to the casting of that spell; Should the spell's level drop to zero or below, the spell is lost.\nSeer of Storms: Divination-like spells, effects, powers, and similar types of magic is always maximized if such an effect is possible for that cast (such as maximizing dice results). Each cast is also modified by 1d6 instead of 1d4 if used within Primeval Power.\nUnrelenting Wind: Trees violently sway back and forth as the wind picks up. A slight rain turns into a torrential downpour. Objects goes tumbling down the road before being swept away by the wind. Poorly made buildings have doors ripped off and windows shattered. Characters must make an Athletics Check or Strength Saving Throw (DC 16) to prevent themselves from being blown away. If a creature is securely holding onto an object, they make the checks with advantage. Failed saves = flown 30 feet away.\nSmall debries flying around\nIf intensified: 60 feet, large objects and debries will cause serious damage to creatures and objects.\n \nSkill Challenge - How it works\nThe power carried by the winds is overwhelming, and can drastically change the surrounding landscape if wielded properly. Characters may attempt to briefly test their might against the storm, diverting the power within to themselves, if only for a brief moment. \nDoing so is a skill challenge. Characters may use their actions, skills, or various abilities to manipulate the powers carried upon the storm to various degrees of success or failure.\nAs a general rule it will always cost an action to attempt a skill challenge, though it can be part of doing something else, such as casting a spell costing an action. Some skill challenges may require multiple rolls to be completed by different characters before being completed. Such as \"Escape the Temple\" which is comprised of 8 skill challenges which needs to be filled with 8 successes before failures to resolve. In this skill challenge multiple players may work together against a common goal, or work on a singular challenge themselves.\nA challenge may be: Player says: \"I want to still the winds in an area around me for some time\"\nDM says: \"Okay, so like in an area centered around you to grant you some respite for the storm, or in a bigger area for all your allies too?\"\nPlayers says: \"I was thinking more of a limitied area that moves with me and lets me use ranged attacks without disadvantage due to the heavy winds for a few rounds\"\nDM says: \"Okay, that souds like a smaller but spesific effect that only affects yourself and your projectiles, so maybe a skill challenge requiering two successes?\"\nPlayer says: \"Hm, that kinda destroys my plan if im using two turns getting that to potentially work. What if I used my Warding Wind spell to help me lessen the winds around me to help me with that?\"\nDM says: \"Yeah, that sound doable - a way to manipulate the wind in some manner in addition to your intent. Lets say one skill challenge success needed for that one them. How does this look, what do we see you do in attempts to control the winds in this manner?\"\nPlayer says: \"Uh, maybe using magic of some kind? Like im twisting the magic beyond it's normal use but enhancing it with the strange obviously-magical storm around me to steal some omph from that?\"\nDm says: \"Okay, cool! That sounds like you are using Arcane maybe, or perhaps a concentration check?\"\nPlayer grumbles: \"...but my Atheletics score is better >:(\"\n.. and so the story goes - okay the last part is a joke but I hope you kinda get what a skill challenge is :D\n \nWill of the Myths:\nThese are examples of the different sources which can be pulled from within the storm.\n \nDominion's Flame: The fire of ambition. Endless. Limitless. Conflagerating the wills of all.\nYou may wield the wind with singular focus and ambition, drastically shaping those within it. Andrenaline beating like drums for creatures, sending them into a frenzy. You could cause all attack rolls to be rolled at advantage, but cause every creature to gain vulnerability to damage in their reckless abandon. \n \nThe Thousand-Named: It stained our bloodline. Past. Present. Future. All melded together in terrible harmony.\nCreatures within the storm may experience visions of the past, present, and future vividly, greatly inhiting one's sense of self. A creature may be unable to move, become confused, overwhelmed, or experience insight during this time. Spesific focuses comes at a higher DC, such as choosing a spesific creature to be targeted by a spesific vision.\nExamples\nSpiritblood: Choose a creature, you may attempt to gleam what their next turn will be.\nBroken Fate: Attempt to twist the storm, changing what is yet to come. You may attempt to influence the future slightly, for example causing a spesific action to be taken, an event to occur, or some other effect of chance to occur.\n \nThe Lifewind: ..where in time all shall be reborn\nTwist destruction to creation. Feel the rejuvenating power that shifts seasons and causes life to bloom. You may attempt to shift the destructive properties of the storm to something which creates life. Wounds may close, pain recede, or trauma be lessened.\nExamples \nLifewind Embrace: All creatures are healed for 10% of their maximum hit points at the start of their turn, but receive disadvantage on all saving throws.\nRampant Growth: Cause decaying plant-matter to instantly grow to life, making thorny vines that impede movement in an area. \n \nThe Wandering Wind: .. how long you've wandered, burned bright as a spark\nFeel a familiar wind settle upon the area, obscuring or revealing secrets, causing steps to quicken in search of the unknown. Shift stillness to momentum, ignorance to knowledge. The hidden to the known.\nExamples\nUncover secrets, see what is hidden, uncover deeper meaning and understanding. \nHide something or someone.\nCreate momentum, control movement, wander\n \nThe Lantern's Light: .. and amidst deepest despair, light everlasting\nThe land twists and churns, destroyed by storms and debris. Life and destruction in constant flux, all bringing constant death of mortals and spirits alike. Shift the cycle brielfy, if only for one fleeting moment. \nExamples:Veil's Breath: Creatures cannot gain the dying status when falling unconcious. They are instead stabilized. Any dying creatures instantly stabilizie.\nLost Light: Attempt to unveil what remains of the creatures twisted by the storm. Understand what they once were, before returning to the storm once more.\n \nSpiritwind: Lo do they call to me, lo do their words travel upon the currents, shaping all that is.\nYou may alter the wind itself, causing it to shift and change to affect those within it. Yourself and up to 1d4 other creatures of your choice within 80 feet gains a flying speed of 60 feet for 1d4 rounds. Whenever the duration runs out, or if the power is ended early, the character falls to the ground. \nPrimeval note: All spoken language will be heard and understood clearly within the battlefield, regardless of the overwhelming storm.\n \n \nStorm's Wake: Feel the rumbling sky, the beating heart of thunder. The destructive shaping of the land.\nThe ground of this area rumbles and cracks, throwing opponents in disarray. While in this area, creatures cannot take immediate reactions or triggered actions between turns. This effect can be attempted to focus upon a spesific or smaller area, but at a higher skill check DC. One might even attempt to drastically change terrain or weather in an area.\nExamples:\nFury: All creatures may only use their action if it includes making an attack roll. In no hostile targets are within range a friendly target must instead be chosen.\nUnyielding: Refuse the end.Cause an area to become difficult terrain\nForce creatures within an area to fall prone\nCause lightning to strike\nBring down powerful winds\n \nThe Lost: .. This I believe, here at memory's end. \nStillness. Nothingness. Cling to that sinking feeling the unmakes all things. \nCause stillness and decay, and the immesurable sorrow that comes with it. You may attempt to end any effect caused by the storms, such as a passive effect of Yre, or another manipulation Will of the Myths. Permanent alterations increases the DC, lessening effects or durations may be achieved at lower dc's. Altering an effect might be possible at very high DCs.\nExamples\nCause something or someone to become forgotten briefly, as if it never existed\nEnd any effect\n \n \n \n \nExamples: (From Overwhelming Spirit - Lightningcow)\nRaging Wind: A powerful windstorm blows through the battlefield. Roll a random direction (1d4). Creatures gain +10 movement speed when moving with the wind, and -10 movement speed when moving against it. All ranged attacks have disadvantage, and all range increments for ranged attacks are halved.\nFated Wind: All critical tresholds are increased to 15-20, and healing from any source is halved.\nScattered and Forgotten: Skill checks cannot be made during this effect. All creatures lose access to two random abilities or features, which are randomly rolled for at the start of their turn.\nFlames of Dominion: All attacks are made at advantage during this effect, but creatures cannot willingly move away from their enemies.\nLifewind Embrace: All creatures are healed for 10% of their maximum hit points at the start of their turn, but receive disadvantage on all saving throws."]}, {"name": "The Immortal Heart", "pages": ["42\nA Crystalline Fragment - The Immortal Heart\nA crystalline heart with deep blue veins breaking the surface of the crystal.\n \nThe hearts feels heavy in your hands.
