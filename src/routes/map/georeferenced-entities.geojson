This wind marks a heightened period of sorcery, and the most important hunts of the Orian cycle which sustains the precious supplies needed to maintain wards and most forms of sorcery. In modern times many supplies are traded and stockpiled from other cultures, but some Orians still partake in hunts by way of tradition or seeking personal glory and wealth.</p><p></p><p>Nearly all Orian practicioners of Warding start their practial training during Ys-Kora to better understand the Flame before mastering it many Cycles later.</p><p><strong>Adiyah:</strong> Now, the Arts are three: Flame, Spirit, and Creation. Flame can change one thing into another - usually power, such as abyssal ink into a gust of wind. The same Flame can be bound with words or writing. This is the basis of how we create wards.</p><p>Ys-Kora's Flame is described by many practicioners as making their own small alterations to a story as it's being told. Wards are a \"stable\" version of this art - where these stories has already been bound to an object, such as paper, waiting to be told.</p><p></p><p><strong>Murus:</strong> Some of the northern Tribes sustain themselves entierly by a successful hunt during this current. Creatures of the deep are known to surface more frequently, and amongst these are the greatest leviathans of the deep. Aside from the meat and blubber used to sustain a Tribe the Oil is highly coveted by Orian traders which fuels our economy. Hinekoran hunts are allowed for proven warbands, and only fools would attempt one without cycles-long training. To hunt a leviathan without proper tradition and respect is to invite doom upon all Tribes.</p><p><strong>Akari:</strong> Tal-Kovai is a dangerous time in the Sea of Clouds. After a full Wind of spirts gathering, many large beasts wake from their cycle-long slumber to feast. It is the true test of any Cloudwarden to protect their home during this time.</p><p><strong>Party notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Woden: The ruins beneath Yggranat's Lock held Woden, an eidolon connected to Ys-Kora.</p></li><li><p>Spiritgorger Tarkir: Would match Akari's description, but the time you encounetred it does not match to the Wind when you fought it, which was during late Arat.</p></li></ul>", "<p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">N'yliah (Ashen), , Odnaru (Hkari), Izari (Norai) - The Thousand-Named</span></p><ul style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px;padding:0px 0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The Ancient Wind, the Rite of Tradition</span></p></li></ul><p>The Wind marks a long period of restlessness within the lands.

It is a very rare, powerful, and coveted art. Common uses include warping the wind to move across immense distances, divining what is hidden, or casting ones perception across vast gulfs of time and space. This art is extremely hard to master and rarely sees use except for ancient masters of very powerful sorcerers.</p><p>I know a fragment of this art, and that is to let Wind shape me to move quickly.</p><p></p><p><strong>Akari:</strong> Adiyah makes is sound way too complicated.

Akarot is the primal drive of this experience and manifestation. They were the first to harness this experience into change, the first to Create something from what was once nothing. They are the origin of the First Art, from which all other things bloomed. Their will shaped the raw sorcery of the land like clay, forming vessels and creatures which danced upon the winds. They are the Creator of all Spirits, and the source of all primal sorcery.</p><p><br><strong>Adiyah:</strong> Listen well, for Akarot holds the most powerful and dangerous Art to master, the rarest of all three. Theirs is a dark Flame of starlight and nightsky. The Black Flame has one fundemental use, and that is to create something from nothing, allowing direct creation of matter, energy, and life. The Red Flame requires existing material to warp, the White Flame warps the self, and the Black Flame requires none.

This wind marks a heightened period of sorcery, and the most important hunts of the Orian cycle which sustains the precious supplies needed to maintain wards and most forms of sorcery. In modern times many supplies are traded and stockpiled from other cultures, but some Orians still partake in hunts by way of tradition or seeking personal glory and wealth.</p><p></p><p>Nearly all Orian practicioners of Warding start their practial training during Ys-Kora to better understand the Flame before mastering it many Cycles later.</p><p><strong>Adiyah:</strong> Now, the Arts are three: Flame, Spirit, and Creation. Flame can change one thing into another - usually power, such as abyssal ink into a gust of wind. The same Flame can be bound with words or writing. This is the basis of how we create wards.</p><p>Ys-Kora's Flame is described by many practicioners as making their own small alterations to a story as it's being told. Wards are a \"stable\" version of this art - where these stories has already been bound to an object, such as paper, waiting to be told.</p><p></p><p><strong>Murus:</strong> Some of the northern Tribes sustain themselves entierly by a successful hunt during this current. Creatures of the deep are known to surface more frequently, and amongst these are the greatest leviathans of the deep. Aside from the meat and blubber used to sustain a Tribe the Oil is highly coveted by Orian traders which fuels our economy. Hinekoran hunts are allowed for proven warbands, and only fools would attempt one without cycles-long training. To hunt a leviathan without proper tradition and respect is to invite doom upon all Tribes.</p><p><strong>Akari:</strong> Tal-Kovai is a dangerous time in the Sea of Clouds. After a full Wind of spirts gathering, many large beasts wake from their cycle-long slumber to feast. It is the true test of any Cloudwarden to protect their home during this time.</p><p><strong>Party notes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Woden: The ruins beneath Yggranat's Lock held Woden, an eidolon connected to Ys-Kora.</p></li><li><p>Spiritgorger Tarkir: Would match Akari's description, but the time you encounetred it does not match to the Wind when you fought it, which was during late Arat.</p></li></ul>", "<p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">N'yliah (Ashen), , Odnaru (Hkari), Izari (Norai) - The Thousand-Named</span></p><ul style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px;padding:0px 0px 0px 1.5em;color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The Ancient Wind, the Rite of Tradition</span></p></li></ul><p>The Wind marks a long period of restlessness within the lands.

It is a very rare, powerful, and coveted art. Common uses include warping the wind to move across immense distances, divining what is hidden, or casting ones perception across vast gulfs of time and space. This art is extremely hard to master and rarely sees use except for ancient masters of very powerful sorcerers.</p><p>I know a fragment of this art, and that is to let Wind shape me to move quickly.</p><p></p><p><strong>Akari:</strong> Adiyah makes is sound way too complicated.

Akarot is the primal drive of this experience and manifestation. They were the first to harness this experience into change, the first to Create something from what was once nothing. They are the origin of the First Art, from which all other things bloomed. Their will shaped the raw sorcery of the land like clay, forming vessels and creatures which danced upon the winds. They are the Creator of all Spirits, and the source of all primal sorcery.</p><p><br><strong>Adiyah:</strong> Listen well, for Akarot holds the most powerful and dangerous Art to master, the rarest of all three. Theirs is a dark Flame of starlight and nightsky. The Black Flame has one fundemental use, and that is to create something from nothing, allowing direct creation of matter, energy, and life. The Red Flame requires existing material to warp, the White Flame warps the self, and the Black Flame requires none.
