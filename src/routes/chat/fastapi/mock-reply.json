They trade with Mane, a large and dangerous creature, and acquire valuable items such as a nightcap of vision and a crystalline chisel. They also barter with Main, a spiritborn, and make a deal to bring back shiny items in exchange for a vial of remembrance and other items. The players then engage in a trading session with Mane, trading various items including gemstones, dragon scales, and magical tools for shiny and valuable objects. Mane expresses interest in moonstones, tears, textiles, clothing, and certain metals and minerals. \n\nLater, the players continue their exploration and come across ruins in the Garden of the Moon. They discover an old inscription representing the people from Ori, predating the Ark and the Imperium. They investigate further and find a scroll case held by skeletal hands, which triggers a magical event. The session ends with the players about to engage in combat with mysterious entities."

Days.\nYou know it.\nSo, which one is it,\nIvor? Cade's?\nCade.\nIn that case, Cade, give me a\nhistory check with advantage.\nThey help you with\nexactly nothing.\nI think...\nAnd this would be very tough research,\nbecause you find yourself going through many\nbooks and manuscripts and old scrolls\nof information.\nI think the only thing that's\nclearly indicated for you\nis maybe this.\nInformation that's in the library about\nthe race they call the ashen.\nYou find references to\nhumanoids with these bat-like\nwings and ears,\nsome characteristic traits that are like\nthat sounds like Adia's people.\nMost of what you find out is that they are\nreferred to as one of\nthe races that are a large part\nof the Arcane Imperium.\nAnd you don't find any\nnewer references, like cross-references\nwith what you know Adia told you\nabout Urus and\nAkari.\nNone of the information that comes from them\nyou find correlating here, so it's a clear mismatch.\nYou don't get 100%\nconfirmation, but you don't\nfind out\nwhat time period necessarily\nwith an 8.\nExcept for the fact that none of the\ninformation you have previously matches this.\nThis looks like\ntalking. And I think that would\nbe fairly obvious.\nAs Dimas mentioned\nearlier, there is a large time gap\nbetween the information stored here\nand what you know.\nInteresting.\nIt's nice to have that\nconfirmed.\nUnfortunately, an 8 doesn't\nhave as much detail on specific events\nthat you could call out.\nI think that would be easily\ngleamed information even with an 8.\nAlright.\n...\nMhm.\nThe ones he sees like\nOh, this one is almost crumbling already.\nMhm.\n...\nMhm.\nYeah.\nDo you want to investigate more of the other themes as well?\nI mean, sure.\nI can check out\nMoss, or try to figure\n...\nRight.\nI like this picture of you"
